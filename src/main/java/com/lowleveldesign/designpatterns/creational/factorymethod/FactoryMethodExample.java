/**
 * Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
 *
 * In short:
 *
 * Instead of calling new SomeClass() directly â†’ delegate object creation to a factory method.
 *
 * This makes your code loosely coupled, scalable, and testable.
